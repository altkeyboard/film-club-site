## 🎥 Story in a Nutshell

A simple story usually has:
- **A character**
- **A goal**
- **A problem**
- **A change**

Quick check:
- What does your character **want**?
- What’s **stopping** them?
- What changes by the **end**?

## 🎬 Shot Types (Quick Guide)

Try using different shot types to make your film feel more “movie-like”:

- **Wide Shot** – shows the whole place (sets the scene)
- **Medium Shot** – shows a person from about the waist up
- **Close-Up** – shows emotion or an important detail
- **POV (Point of View)** – shows what a character sees

🎯 Mini challenge: film a 10-second scene using **Wide → Medium → Close-Up**.

## 🔊 Sound Makes a Huge Difference

Even a great video can feel “off” if the sound is hard to hear.

Try:
- Record in a quieter spot (away from vents/fans)
- Keep the microphone close to the speaker (without being in the shot)
- Listen with headphones before you submit

🎯 Mini challenge: record the same line from **2 feet away vs 10 feet away** and compare.

## ✂️ Editing Tips (Simple but Powerful)

- Cut out the “dead time” at the beginning and end of shots
- Keep scenes moving (shorter is often stronger)
- Watch your film once with the sound **off** — does it still make sense?

🎯 Mini challenge: make a scene 20% shorter without changing the story.

## 🎨 Poster + Title Tips

A great poster helps people *want* to watch your film.

- Use **big, readable text**
- Pick **1–2 fonts** (more can look messy)
- Make the title match the mood (funny, spooky, dramatic)
- Keep it simple and bold

⭐ Bonus: include a short tagline like:
- “A small mistake… big consequences.”
- “The mystery starts at midnight.”
