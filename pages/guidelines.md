## Respectful feedback rules
We use feedback to help each other improve.

Try:
- “One thing that worked well was…”
- “One question I had was…”
- “One idea to try next time is…”

Avoid:
- Put-downs or personal comments
- Sharing someone’s film outside the club without permission

## Content guidelines
All films must follow school expectations for appropriate content and respectful behavior.

## Sharing permissions
Films are only posted publicly with advisor approval and creator permission.
